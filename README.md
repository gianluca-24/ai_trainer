# ai_trainer
ai_trainer is an app developed to help people improve their push-up technique. We chose push-ups because they are a common exercise that many people perform incorrectly.
The app works on both PC and smartphone.
All you need is a camera, a microphone, and enough space to do the exercises.

We use the MediaPipe model to recognize skeletal joints from live video. By analyzing the positions of these joints, we evaluate distances and angles, and set thresholds for common mistakes in the exercise. When you make an error, the app provides real-time feedback, helping you correct your form during the workout.
The app is fully "hands-free"â€”after starting, you can control everything with voice commands.
There is also a scoring feature and an exercise history, so you can track your progress over time.
